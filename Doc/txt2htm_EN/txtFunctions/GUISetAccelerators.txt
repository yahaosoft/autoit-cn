The array passed to this function contains the hotkey and the control ID of the accelerator. The array must be defined as Dim $array[n][2] - where n is the number of accelerator keys to set:

$array[0][0] = Hotkey (in HotKeySet() format) of 1st accelerator
$array[0][1] = Control ID of the 1st accelerator, as returned by GUICtrlCreate...()
$array[1][0] = Hotkey of 2nd accelerator
$array[1][1] = Control ID of the 2nd accelerator
