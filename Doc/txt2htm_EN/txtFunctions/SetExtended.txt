SetExtended

###Description###

###Syntax###
SetExtended ( code [, return value] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
code
	The required value (integer) to set the @extended macro to.
return value
	[optional] Override the default return value and return this parameter.
@@End@@


###ReturnValue###
By default, none, however, if the optional return value argument is passed, then the function will return that value.


###Remarks###
When entering a function @extended is set to 0.  Unless SetExtended() is called, then @extended will remain 0 after the function has ended.  This means that in order for @extended to be set after a function, it must be explicitly set.  This also means you may need to backup the status of @extended in a variable if you are testing it in a While-WEnd loop.
